# Diwali Sales Analysis & Business Insights

Project Objective

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of Diwali sales data from a retail store. The goal was to move beyond raw data to identify key customer trends and provide actionable recommendations for the marketing and sales teams to increase profitability.

## 📈 My Business Recommendations

Based on my analysis, I recommend the following data-driven strategies:

Target Your Core Audience: Marketing efforts and ad spend should be overwhelmingly focused on females between 26-35 years old. This demographic is the company's most valuable and highest-spending customer segment.

Optimize Regional Campaigns: Allocate a larger marketing and inventory budget to the top-performing states: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. These regions are the primary revenue drivers.

Prioritize Key Product Categories: Ensure Food, Clothing, and Electronics are heavily featured in all promotions. These categories are the most popular and generate the most revenue. Consider creating special offers or bundles for these items.

Tailor Your Messaging: Given that unmarried customers drive a significant portion of sales, marketing messaging can be tailored to this group. Campaigns focused on "gifting for friends" or "treat yourself" could be highly effective.

## 💡 Key Business Insights

My recommendations are based on these key insights, which I uncovered from the data:

Who is the primary customer?

By Gender: Females are the core customer base, not only in volume but also in total sales value. They significantly outspend males.

By Age: The 26-35 age group is the "sweet spot," representing the largest and highest-spending group of customers.

By Marital Status: Unmarried customers (Marital Status = 0) contribute more to the total sales revenue.

Where are the top markets?

By State: The business is heavily concentrated in specific high-value regions. The top 3 states by a large margin are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.

What are they buying?

By Product: Customer spending is focused on a few key categories. The most popular and profitable items are Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics & Gadgets.

### 🛠️ Technology & Workflow

To get these insights, I performed the full end-to-end analysis, from cleaning to visualization.

Tools: Python (Pandas), Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables), MySQL, and Tableau.

#### Workflow:

Cleaned and prepared the raw data in both Python and Excel.

Performed exploratory analysis (EDA) in Python and Excel to find initial trends.

Imported the clean data into a MySQL database and wrote SQL queries to aggregate and analyze the data.

Visualized all findings in Tableau and combined them into the final, interactive dashboard linked above.
